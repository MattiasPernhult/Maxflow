# Maxflow
Implementation of the Ford-Fulkersons maxflow algorithm using C# as programming language.

### Preview of the application
The application lets the user add edges between nodes and calculates the maximal matching of nodes.

### Why?
This was an assignment in one of my course (Datastructures and algorithms) during my bachelor degree in software development at Malm√∂ University. The assignment was to solve the linear programming problem bipartite matching, but the algorithm also solves flows in network (which is not implemented in the application).
